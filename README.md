## Sumary

Hungry Shark is a game created using HTLM, canvas,CSS and Javascript.
The goal is to eat 30 small fishes while dodgin enemy mines.
  
## Motivation

The purpose of this project was to get familiar with Javascript  vanilla and HTML canvas. I choosed a game instead of a web app because it is more engaging and visual.
  
## Getting Started

To start the game you simply have to click "Start Game" button. Once you are playing, the movement is based on clicks, so you must click in the position you want your shark to go. Try to eat as many fishes as possible while dodgin mines droped by enemy submarines. If you die or win, you can restart the game by clicking the "Play Again" button.
